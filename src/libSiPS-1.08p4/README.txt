[DESCRIPTION]

  "SiPS/SiPSi" are C libraries of single-machine scheduling problem
solvers.  These can handle the total weighted earliness-tardiness
problems without idle time (libSiPS) and with idle time (libSiPSi).
The detailed algorithm is presented in our papers.

[REQUIREMENTS]

  It has been tested on Linux boxes with gcc.   It can also be compiled
by Visual C++ on Windows.

[LICENSE]

  "SiPS/SiPSi" are distributed under the 2-clause BSD license.
