    (SiPS/sips.h, SiPSi/sipsi.h, */default.h, common/main.c,
    common/subgradient.c, common/param.c).
  - The reference manual is updated accordingly (doc/manual.tex).

Jun  6 2013
  - DEFAULT_LK1 and DEFAULT_LK2 are changed to DEFAULT_INITSTEP1,
    DEFAULT_INITSTEP2, respectively (*/default.h).
  - param.lk1 and param.lk2 are changed to param.initstep1 and
    param.initstep2, respectively (SiPS/sips.h, SiPSi/sipsi.h,
    common/param.c, common/subgradient.c).
  - Options "-lk1" and "-lk2" in the frontend program are changed
    to "-is1" and "-is2", respectively.  For downward compatibility,

May 30 2013 - 1.08p1
  - A bug in _lag2_add_modifiers_LR2m_*() is fixed.
    When the maximum number of modifiers (SIPS_MAX_MODIFIERS) is set to 8,
    Stage 3 did not work correctly due to an overflow in mtable.
    To avoid it, mtable is changed from (char *) to (unsigned char *)
    (common/lag2.c).
  - _timer_start() is called before problem_create_graph()
    in SiPS_solve() and SiPS_compute_lb() (common/solve.c).
    It will not affect the computation time at all.
  - "length" is changed from int to size_t in SiPS_TWT_set_job(),
    SiPS_TWT_set_jobs(), SiPS_TWET_set_job(), and SiPS_TWET_set_jobs()
    (*/problem.c).
  - Cast "(int)" is added to the return value of _n_per_block()
    to suppress warnings when built by MS Visual Studio (common/bmemory.c).
  - Use fopen_s()/sscanf_s() instead of fopen()/sscanf() when built by MS
    Visual Studio (*/problem.c).
  - Use memcpy() instead of strncpy() (*/problem.c).
  - Use snprintf_s() when built by MS Visual Studio (SiPSi/problem.c).
  - Remove snprintf() (SiPS/problem.c).
  - The maximum length of a job name is restricted to MAXNAMELEN
    in SiPS_set_job_name() and SiPS_set_job_names()
    as in SiPS_TWT_set_job() (common/prob_common.c).
  - The year in Copyright is updated from 2012 to 2013 
    (all the source files, LICENSE).
  - The reference manual is improved (docs/manual.*).
  - README is updated.
Mar 30 2012 - 1.08
  (Many thanks to Halil Sen)
  - A bug in _lag_solve_LR1_forward_with_domain() is fixed.
    prec_set_sd_t() should be inside the loop (common/lag.c).
  - obj_lesser_equal(), obj_greater_equal() and obj_equal() are
    modified so that they work correctly for large real objective
    values (common/define.h).
  - Inequalities including lbeps are modified so that only lbeps
    exists in the right-hand side (common/lag.c common/lag2.c
    common/ssdp.c common/subgradient.c).
  - LARGE_REAL and LARGE_REAL2 are increased (common/define.h).
Mar 17 2012
  - lbeps is changed from (-eps) to (eps) when COST_REAL is defined
    (common/param.c, common/prob_common.c).
Mar 16 2012 - 1.07p3
  - The default objective function type is changed from SIPS_COST_INTEGER
    to SIPS_COST_REAL (common/param.c).  This is valid only when COST_REAL
    is defined.  
Mar 15 2012
  - The option "-dlv" is removed from the front-end programs
    (common/main.c).
  - The reference manual is updated (docs/manual.*).
  - A typo is fixed (docs/sample.c).
Feb 26 2012
  - Two new functions SiPS_get_job() and SiPS_get_jobs()
    (*/problem.c SiPS/sips.h SiPSi/sipsi.h).
  - The reference manual is updated (docs/manual.*).
Feb  6 2012 - 1.07p2
  - mtable[] memory overrun is fixed in _lag2_add_modifiers_LR2m_*()
    (common/lag2.c).
Jan 28 2012
  - _n_per_block() and create_benv() (common/bmemory.[ch]):
    The type of the arguments is changed from "int" to "size_t".
Jan 25 2012 - 1.07p1
  - Fixed a bug for SiPSi in solution_set_c() (common/sol.c).
Jan  3 2012 - 1.07
  - Initial official release.
